# Synthetic seismogram modelling in Python
This repository contains code to model synthetic seismograms with data derived from measurements of sediment cores with a GeoTek MSCL unit. 

Example data is available in the data.csv file. Your own data should follow the same structure; otherwise it will be necessary to adjust the initial variable assignments.
